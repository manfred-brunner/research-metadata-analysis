Crayfish, prominent invaders on multiple continents, pose significant varied threats. Using species distribution models (SDMs), this study explores the current and future potential distribution of\xa0 Pontastacus leptodactylus , a widely introduced but under-studied crayfish, at Eurasian scale. Climate is crucial for most species’ distributions and historically SDMs focused primarily on these variables, while overlooking other environmental factors influencing species occurrence. This research employed 2 approaches: one climatic and one broader environmental model encompassing soil pH and elevation data. Both methods revealed high suitability for the species, particularly currently in Central-Europe. Future climate scenarios for 2050 do not seem to favour the species in terms of intermediate-high suitability regions, with contractions also in the native regions with both approaches. However, remarkable discrepancies were observed in some North-European regions; with the climatic approach predicting high suitability where the environmental approach did not. This study identifies\xa0 P. leptodactylus \xa0as a widespread successful species outside its native range with potential for expansion under current conditions. The synthesised continental overview and projected distribution maps aid in prioritising monitoring and prevention efforts while underlining the importance for using environmental as well as climatic variables in SDMs.'}","['Life Sciences', 'Freshwater & Marine Ecology', 'Ecology', 'Zoology']","[{'id': '3512', 'term': 'Freshwater and Marine Ecology'}, {'id': '3370', 'term': 'Ecology'}, {'id': '3399', 'term': 'Zoology'}]"

SIA revealed juvenile fish as a major prey item at one of the sites (63 and 50% of the diet of small and the large fish), while GCA showed pumpkinseed preying mostly on macroinvertebrates (chironomids, gastropods, Ephemeroptera, and Zygoptera larvae) at both sites.

This study fills this major gap in NIS management by proposing a comprehensive and practical framework that integrates systematic reviews, meta-analyses, species distribution modelling, and expert judgement to assess NIS impacts across varying levels of information availability. The framework also recommends complementary, under-utilised data sources, and tools to reduce significantly existing information constraints. The framework presented in this study not only advances scientific understanding of NIS impacts by providing a scalable and adaptable framework for assessing NIS impacts in different ecological contexts, but also provides practical tools for environmental managers implementing legislation on NIS.

This method is commonly employed for assessing hydrometeorological triggers similar to sites with documentary-based landslide catalogues. However, uncertainties arise in setting dendrogeomorphic thresholds and using diverse climate data sources for trigger identification. This paper reconstructs the activity of six landslides using tree-ring records in a region with well-documented landsliding and long-term climate data from rain gauges. The objective was to test different dendrogeomorphic approaches for identifying landslide event year and to analyse various rain, snow, and soil moisture parameters from meteorological stations and climate reanalyses to identify triggers. This involved examining how variations in each research step affect results and potentially enhancing the interpretation of landslide triggers. Documentary data indicated frequent landsliding during spring and summer, while tree-ring chronologies showed the strongest connection to increased winter and spring precipitation measured by rain gauges, suggesting an enhancement of winter precipitation as a potential climate preparatory factor. Furthermore, the results showed that combining tree-ring and documentary data yielded more statistically informative links than using tree-ring data alone. Additionally, integrating gridded data from ERA5-Land climate reanalyses enhanced the interpretation of explanatory factors. While increased winter and spring precipitation were most strongly linked to landslide initiation using precipitation data, volumetric soil water content derived from reanalysis data was crucial for identifying summer landslide occurrences. Incorporating soil water content into dendrogeomorphic research improved the interpretation of landslide initiation timing. Therefore, regional tree-ring-based chronologies with improved identification of landslide triggers can significantly reduce uncertainties in decision-making when it comes to landslide hazard management. Future research should explore the effectiveness of freely available satellite-based precipitation data with tree-ring chronologies, particularly in regions with limited information on precipitation intensity.'}","['Earth Sciences', 'Natural Hazards', 'Geography, general', 'Agriculture', 'Civil Engineering']","[{'id': '3815', 'term': 'Natural Hazards'}, {'id': '3857', 'term': 'Geography'}, {'id': '2872', 'term': 'Agriculture'}, {'id': '3586', 'term': 'Civil Engineering'}]"

A combination of diatom and geochemical analyses of the recently deposited sediments of Odensjön, a small dimictic lake in southern Sweden, shows alternating light and dark laminae composed of greater amounts of biogenic silica and organic matter, respectively. As confirmed by independent radiometric dating and Pb pollution data, and supported by scanning electron microscopy of individual laminae, these features represent ongoing deposition of biogenic varves. Corresponding diatom and geochemical data obtained from a 92-cm long freeze core provide evidence of substantial lake-ecosystem dynamics during the last six centuries, related mainly to variations in light penetration and wind shear driven by human-induced changes in catchment vegetation. The diatom assemblage of Odensjön’s varved sediments is dominated by planktonic species, primarily Asterionella formosa, Fragilaria saxoplanktonica and Discostella lacuskarluki during periods of forest cover, while increased catchment openness from the mid-1500s to the late 1800s led to increased abundance of Lindavia comensis . Long-term variations in climate and land use, mediated through changing length of the ice-cover season and nutrient input, respectively, probably contributed to the observed trends, as well as to variations in the appearance and visibility of the varve record across the sampled sediment sequence.
